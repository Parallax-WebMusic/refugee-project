                <br>
                <p>
                    Ensuring equal access to quality education, including primary, secondary and tertiary education, is a fundamental human right enshrined in international conventions and national laws. 
                    Refugees, including children, adolescents and adults, have the opportunity to enroll in formal education programs that meet their academic needs. 
                    In addition, efforts should be made to remove barriers to education, such as language barriers, transportation problems, and financial constraints, that may prevent refugees from accessing educational opportunities. 
                    By prioritizing access to education, Thessaloniki can give refugees the opportunity to build a brighter future for themselves.
                </p>
                <h1 id="2">2. Language barriers:</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Language proficiency is critical for refugees to fully participate in educational activities and integrate into the local community. 
                    Language and integration programs offer refugees the opportunity to learn Greek, as well as acquire cultural knowledge and essential life skills that facilitate their integration into society. 
                    Programs may include language courses, cultural orientation classes, and hands-on workshops on topics such as job readiness, health literacy, and civic engagement. 
                    Moreover, collaboration between educational institutions, government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community organizations is essential to implement effective language and integration programs tailored to the specific needs of refugees in Thessaloniki. 
                    By investing in language and integration programs, Thessaloniki can give refugees the opportunity to overcome language barriers and adapt to their new environment.

                <h1 id="3">3. Support for Youth:</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Refugee children and youth are a vulnerable group with unique educational needs and challenges. 
                    Ensuring access to quality education for refugee children is essential for their cognitive development, psychosocial well-being and future prospects. 
                    Thessaloniki prioritizes the enrollment of refugee children in formal educational institutions, including primary and secondary schools, and provides additional support services such as language assistance, academic tutoring and psychosocial support to meet their specific needs. 
                    By investing in the education of refugee children and youth, Thessaloniki is strengthening their resilience, promoting social inclusion and breaking the cycle of poverty and marginalization.
                </p>
                <h1 id="4">4. Higher Degree Education:</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Access to higher education is a path to empowerment and self-sufficiency for refugee students in Thessaloniki. 
                    Thessaloniki provides equal opportunities for refugee students to obtain higher education, including university degrees and vocational training programs that are essential to their academic and professional development. 
                    Thessaloniki provides scholarships, financial aid and other forms of support to refugee students to help them overcome financial barriers and access higher education opportunities. 
                    In addition, academic institutions offer language support services and academic advising to ease students' transition to higher education.
